Title: "Improving Random Floating Point Number Generation"
Date: 04-06-2021

Academic Mentor: Prof. David Malone

Project Description:
Random numbers are used in many applications, from statistics,
through gaming to cryptography. For mathematical applications it
often important that the numbers come from a particular distribution,
e.g. a uniform or a normal distribution. However, the way that
computers store numbers, particularly floating point numbers, can
present some challenges to the generation of floating point numbers.
The aim of this project is to understand some of these limitations
and investigate some possible improvements.
